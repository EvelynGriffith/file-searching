### What is the purpose of the `pyproject.toml` file?

The purpose of the pyproject.toml file is to create a virtual environment for the code to live in. It will set the linting tools in order so that they can best be used as well as allowing for the user to have information on the package settings. This file is very useful because it also allows for the dependencies that the file needs to live on through the environment that it creates. However, I think that the most important part of this file is that it allows the dependencies to connect together and work together so that they can be the most productive in the given environment.

### What is the purpose of the `poetry.lock` file?

This file is a lot like the pyproject.toml file because it still involves the dependencies that are used for the created poetry environment. However, this file is different becuase it actually makes it so that your dependencies dont update when working on a project. The way that this was explained to me was that if there is a large company working on a project over an extended period f time, there will be alot of things that will update in the outside world (meaning outside of your environment). Now you need to imagine that everyone working on the file would no longer have the same versions of technology. This would be very bad because now all of a sudden the tech won't do certain things and the project is no longer uniform. This is what the lock file makes sure will never happen. It keeps the project locked in an environment where things that dont need to be changed will not be succeptible to change.
